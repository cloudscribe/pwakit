## Features

Configurable dynamic runtime creation of [serviceworker](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker) using [google workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) to make your web app work offline.

Push notifications - on supported browsers and devices push notifications can be used for both visible notifications and non-visible notifications sent to the serviceworker, for example to instruct the serviceworker to add, update or delete update cached content.

## Try It

You can log into the demo site in this repository using username admin and password admin.

You can then opt in to push notifications and under Administration > Push Notification you can send notifications for testing purposes.


## Credits

Some of the work on serviceworkers was informed by Mads Kristensen's [WebEssentials.AspNetCore.ServiceWorker](https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials.AspNetCore.ServiceWorker)

The work on push notifications was very informed by the work of Tomasz PÄ™czek in his [demo app here](https://github.com/tpeczek/Demo.AspNetCore.PushNotifications), and we are using his library [Lib.Net.Http.WebPush](https://github.com/tpeczek/Lib.Net.Http.WebPush)
